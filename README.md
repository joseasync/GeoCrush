# GeoCrush

**GeoCrush** is an augmented reality (AR) puzzle game developed using Swift and RealityKit, inspired by the popular mechanics of match-three games like Candy Crush. The game leverages Apple's RealityKit framework to bring immersive 3D environments where users can match and clear colored gems that are dynamically placed in the AR world.

### Features

- **Match-Three Puzzle Gameplay**: Classic match-three mechanics where users tap to match gems of the same color.
- **Augmented Reality Environment**: Gems are placed in a 3D AR space, allowing users to interact with the game within their physical environment.

- **Animated Effects**: Enjoy visual effects when gems are matched and cleared.
